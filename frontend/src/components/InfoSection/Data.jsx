Maradonna, Georgie Best. paul McGrath. Baggio. Chopper Harris.No diving. No whining. The realization that we are on a roller-coaster not quite of our control. Take the hits. Roll with the punches. You will not always score. You will not always claim the 3 points, but if you try your little heart out you will succeed more often than not. Always always pick yourself up when you have been knocked down and never ever ever ever....ever give up. Then you will never lose no matter which way the ball decides to roll. The team is king. Rovers Ã¼ber alles. Kickball 4-life.',
